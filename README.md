# 🧩 Cybersecurity Implementation Plan – CSIA 485 Capstone (Project 2)

This repository presents the **Cybersecurity Implementation Plan** for Padgett-Beale Financial Services (PBI-FS), developed as part of my capstone for **CSIA 485: Cybersecurity Management and Policy** at the University of Maryland Global Campus.

Following the acquisition of Island Banking Services, this plan builds upon the previously developed strategy (Project 1) and outlines actionable steps for building a secure, compliant, and resilient IT infrastructure.

---

## 📘 Overview

**Project Focus**: Translating strategy into implementation  
**Company**: Padgett-Beale Financial Services (PBI-FS)  
**Scope**: Secure infrastructure for island-based operations (call center + transaction processing)  
**Compliance**: BSA, GLBA, SOX, NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, CIS Controls

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build secure, isolated systems for PBI-FS operations
- Achieve compliance with U.S. financial laws and international security standards
- Implement layered defenses against internal and external threats
- Replace all legacy and compromised infrastructure from Island Banking Services

---

## 📦 Scope

- ✅ **In-Scope**: Network, servers, call center systems, staff training, monitoring, and backups
- ❌ **Out-of-Scope**: Mainland HQ systems, seized storage media, personal customer devices

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Frameworks Used

- 🏛 **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF v1.1)**
- 📚 **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5**
- 🧰 **CIS Controls v8.1**
- 🔐 **ISO/IEC 27001 & 27002**
- 🔄 **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC – Vee Model)**

---

## 🧱 Key Components

### 🔐 Baseline Security Controls

- Firewalls, IDS/IPS
- MFA for all privileged users
- SIEM & EDR deployment
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Role-based access & least privilege

### 🧰 Compensatory Controls

- Security awareness training (CanIPhish)
- Physical security & badge access
- Threat hunting & patch management
- Vendor risk oversight

| Phase         | Highlights                                                                |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planning      | Define scope, risk appetite, initial compliance mapping                   |
| Requirements  | Trace requirements to ISO, NIST, and legal obligations                    |
| Design        | Segment network zones, define secure architecture                         |
| Development   | Procure/install systems & tools (NGFWs, EDR, MFA)                         |
| Testing       | Vulnerability scans, red teaming, interoperability & compliance audits    |
| Deployment    | Launch call center & transaction systems under secured infrastructure     |
| Maintenance   | Patch management, monitoring, and incident response readiness             |
